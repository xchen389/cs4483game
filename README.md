## How to Play The Game
	
	-download and unzip the game
	-Open a terminal in the root of this and
	write in command line for depending on what language you have:
	
		python -m http.server (On Mac: python3 -m http.server)
		ruby -run -e httpd . -p 8000
		php -S localhost:8000

	then, go to your browser and type:

	localhost:8000 

	to view the game

	to close the local web server, just close the process (in Windows, crtl-c in the commmand line)

	You can always play without audio by just opening index.html, but we don't reccommend this. 

Note: you can edit freely the source files, and see the changes when you refresh in browser while the web server is open (you don't need to restart it).
